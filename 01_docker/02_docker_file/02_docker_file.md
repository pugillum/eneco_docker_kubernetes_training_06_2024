# Dockerfile

> All exercises here should be completed within the context of the folder `02_docker_file`

## Docker build and layers

In the folder `simple_flask`, in the terminal run

```sh
docker build -t simple_flask .
```

Take note of the logs, particularly those that begin with `[n/4]` when `n` is one of the steps.

Now build it again and note how long it takes and the new logs.  What do you notice?

Now change the greeting "Hello World!" in the `app.py` file to "Hi World!"

Again run the build.  What do you notice in the logs?

Run `docker history simple_flask` and look at the layers created.

Run the container using

```sh
docker run --rm -p 8000:5000 simple_flask:latest
```

And access http://localhost:8000 to see a greeting.

## WORKDIR

Let's make use of `WORKDIR`. Adjust the `Dockerfile` to the following:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-alpine

RUN pip3 install flask

WORKDIR /code

COPY app.py .

ENTRYPOINT ["python3"]
CMD ["app.py"]
```

Rebuild your image, check the logs and then ensure that it runs.  How has this impacted the layers?

## Copy multiple files and layers

For a Flask app you'll typically have to install multiple python packages. Still in `simple_flask` directory,  create a file `requirements.txt` containing

```
Flask==3.0.2
```

Adjust the `Dockerfile` to the following:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-alpine

WORKDIR /code

COPY . .

RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

ENTRYPOINT ["python3"]
CMD ["app.py"]
```

Rebuild your image and check the logs and then ensure that it runs.  How has this impacted the layers?

Now again make a change to the greeting in `app.py` and then rebuild the image.  What do you see in the logs? (hint: how many cached layers are used?)

Adjust to this

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-alpine

WORKDIR /code

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

ENTRYPOINT ["python3"]
CMD ["app.py"]
```

Rebuild the image, checking the logs.  Then again make changes to the greeting in `app.py` and again rebuild and check the logs.  What do you see in terms of cached layers?

## `.dockerignore`

Run the following command to access the files of your container

```
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint sh simple_flask
```

Run `ls` and notice that your `README.md` file has also been copied to the container. Exit the container.

Add the file `.dockerignore` to your files (so alongside your `Dockerfile`) containing:

```
README.md
```

Now rebuild your image and then rerun the `docker run ...` command above and then use `ls` to check your files.

## ENTRYPOINT & CMD

Open the folder `entrypoint_and_cmd` in your terminal and build the `Dockerfile`:

```sh
docker build -t myping .
```

Run a container

```
docker run --rm myping
```

Stop the container and then run the following:

```
docker run --rm myping www.facebook.com
```

Notice how you can override the `CMD` value

## Linting

> Note: This command will not work in a PowerShell terminal

In the folder `linting` run the following:

```sh
docker run --rm -i hadolint/hadolint < Baddockerfile
```

What do you see?

## Secrets

### Let's be insecure

In the folder `secrets` take a look at `Dockerfile_insecure`

Build an image by running:
```sh
docker build --build-arg SECRET="I am Batman" -t insecure -f Dockerfile_insecure --no-cache .
```

- `--no-cache` ensures there's no caching of layers
- `--progress=plain` ensures the echo is visible

Now let's inspect the image:
```sh
docker history insecure
```

ðŸ¤¨ What do you notice?

### Now for some security

In the folder `secrets` take a look at `Dockerfile_secure`

Build an image by running:
```sh
docker build --secret id=mysecret,src=$PWD/secret_file -t secure -f Dockerfile_secure --no-cache .
```

Now let's inspect the image:
```sh
docker history secure
```

ðŸ¤¨ What do you notice?

# Key learning points

- Docker images are made up of layers that map to commands in the Dockerfile
- These layers are cached, such that rebuilding the same image will reuse these layers
- Changing the files that form part of a layer invalidate subsequent layers such that these need to be rebuilt
- `WORKDIR` sets the working directory for any subsequent `RUN`, `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`, `COPY` and `ADD` instructions
- `WORKDIR` will also create the specified directory
- Commands which will often result in different files in the image (for e.g. app files) should be run later than commands that will not (e.g. installation of packages) to ensure maximum utilisation of build caching
- `.dockerignore` ensures files not required for the running of the application are not copied into the image, ensuring a smaller image
- Combining `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` allows for flexibility in terms of passing in different inputs when running a container from an image.
- Linting tools like `hadolint` can be used for recommendations about optimising images
- Using build arguments to pass through secrets to use during building of an image is not secure
- For use of secrets during building of an image, use file system mounts
